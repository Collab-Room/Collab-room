# Collab-room

### Problem Statement:
Many students struggle with completing assignments on time due to poor time management and task delegation, resulting in missed deadlines and a negative impact on their grades. In group projects, it can be frustrating to constantly ask team members for updates on their progress, causing delays and additional stress.

### Solution Idea: 
To address this problem, we propose building a free task manager web application for students. This application will allow users to easily delegate tasks to each other and keep track of their deadlines and project status in a collaborative environment. Users can use the website to manage their own projects or group projects with multiple collaborators.


### Technical Stack:
- Programming Languages: JavaScript (for front-end and backend development).
- Front-end Frameworks/Libraries: Vue (for building the UI), Vuex (for state management), Axios (for HTTP requests), Bootstrap and Vuetify (for styling).
- Back-end Frameworks/Libraries: Node.js and Express (for building the API).
- Tools: Git (for version control), MongoDB (for database management).
